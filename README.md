# Maze-Solver-
Maze Solver Algorithm based on Depth First Search from source to the destination and representation using proper Graphical user Interface using Java Swing and JFrame functionalities . 
Technology Used: 1. Java (2d Array)
                 2.GUI
DFS: It recahes out far away from the starting point to the destination and returns only when the destination point is reached succesfully , henceforth in this maze solver dfs algorithm will be the best suited for it 


Array traversal :
-> to access each element stored in the array
-> so that data can be used or checked as a part of process
Access and Check :
- if "1" : blocker
- if "0" : accessable
- if "9" : destination reached
  Time Complexity O(m*n)
The screeen of the MAZE SOLVER will look like this :
